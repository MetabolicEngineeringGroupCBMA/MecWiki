# MecWiki

This wikidpad wiki is useful to start a new wikidpad wiki.


It contains some pages related to molecular biology and the main wiki file has a few modifications. The file ending
 is md instead of .wiki. This enables preview of the wiki page file in dropbox.


It is quite useful to back up the page files using dropbox or a similar service. A problem is the wikiovw.sli file which is present
in the same directory as the page files. This file changes often and is not needed to recreate the wiki in case of a crash.


The MecWiki has the location of the page files in the "MecWikiData" sub directory of the "dropbox" folder,
 while the MecWiki.wiki file and the wikiovw.sli should be present in the folder immediately above the "dropbox" folder.
This means that only the page files will be backed up. 

The "files" folder contain the file storage of the wiki. It contains an image of some yeast cells which is linked from the wiki 
home page "MecWiki.md"

This file "README.md" can be deleted after downloading the wiki.
